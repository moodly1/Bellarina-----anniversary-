Happy-Anniversary — GitHub Pages ready
-------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- music.wav
- README.txt

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example "Happy-Anniversary").
2. Upload all files from this ZIP into the repository (you can drag & drop).
3. Commit the changes.
4. In the repository Settings -> Pages, set the source to the main branch (root).
5. Save — GitHub will provide a URL like:
   https://your-username.github.io/Happy-Anniversary/
6. If autoplay is blocked by the browser, the visitor can press "Play music".

Notes:
- The included music.wav is a short, royalty-free generated instrumental.
- Autoplay may be blocked on some browsers/mobile devices; the Play button will start music.
- If you want an MP3 file instead, you can convert music.wav to MP3 using an audio tool.
- If you want any edits (fonts, colors, text size), tell me the exact changes and I'll update the ZIP.

Enjoy — and happy 1-month anniversary to you and Bellarina! ❤️
