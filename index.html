      <em>To My One and Only â€” Bellarina,</em>

From the very moment we met on WhatsApp, something shifted in my world. I didnâ€™t know it then, but you were about to become the most beautiful part of my life. And now, after everything weâ€™ve shared, I canâ€™t imagine a single day without you. But before I talk about how much I love you, I need to say something that matters even more right now â€” <strong>Iâ€™m sorry</strong>.

I know Iâ€™ve hurt you. Iâ€™ve gotten angry when I shouldâ€™ve been calm. Iâ€™ve disappeared when I shouldâ€™ve stayed. Iâ€™ve changed things that mattered to you â€” like my profile picture or leaving your groups â€” without thinking about how it would make you feel. And most painfully, I havenâ€™t always been present for you late at night, when you just needed me there.

You didnâ€™t deserve any of that. And yet... you stayed. You forgave. You loved me anyway.

You gave me another chance when you had every reason to walk away. You chose love over ego. You chose me â€” again and again. Thatâ€™s not ordinary. Thatâ€™s <em>extraordinary</em>. Thatâ€™s <em>you</em>, Bellarina.

Every day I spend with you feels like a blessing. Whether weâ€™re having deep conversations or just roasting each other until we laugh ourselves breathless â€” those moments are my favorite part of life. Whenever I see your name pop up, my whole mood shifts. Thereâ€™s joy, peace, and a kind of warmth I canâ€™t explain â€” like my heart knows itâ€™s safe with you.

You donâ€™t just love me â€” you teach me how to love. You make me want to be better. You remind me that even with my flaws, someone like you can see something in me worth staying for. That... means the world to me.

I promise you this: Iâ€™ll grow. Iâ€™ll show up. Iâ€™ll be the man you deserve â€” not just in words, but in how I love, protect, and cherish you every day.

This one-month anniversary is more than just a milestone â€” itâ€™s the beginning of something so real, so deep, and so worth fighting for. You are not just my girlfriend. You are <strong>my peace</strong>, <strong>my happiness</strong>, <strong>my home</strong>, and the one I want to build forever with.

Letâ€™s write our story â€” one filled with laughter, healing, growth, and unforgettable memories. Because when I look at you, Bellarina, I see the rest of my life.

With all my heart,<br>
<em>Immanuel</em>
